# Fandom Finder Demo
## Instructions
Use the starter code in starter to build out Fandom Finder for the current parts! All the past parts will be included in the respective folders.

## Results
Take a look inside of `part1/mocks` to see what the final product will look like! If you get stuck, you can use the code in finished to keep going.

This project is extremely barebones version of the class project, but it demonstrates good concepts on how to structure and build your project.
